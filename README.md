 
# Welcome to Kaun Banega Crorepati

  I have coded Kaun Banega Crorepati. The idea behind was to get familiar with python language. This is my first CLI project.

  This game is inspired from an Indian Reality TV Show - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaun_Banega_Crorepati <br>
  It's like a quiz game where there will be 15 questions asked from user. Every question has one correct answer. They can also go for lifelines. At the end you will display the results how much the user earned.
  
### SETUP THE GAME CODE AND PLAY

  *  Install git
  * `git clone https://github.com/seebham/cli-kbc-game.git`
  * `python kbc.py` (to run code, you would be using python3)
